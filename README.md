# Energy Alerter
This project consists of two parts, a server (energymonsrv) and a client (energymonclt), both made with an Arduino, and a few external components. It is inspired by the Open Energy Monitor, of which it uses a slightly modified version of the EmonTx V2.
Watch out further progresses on the web page dedicated to the project ( http://clockgenerator.blogspot.it/2016/04/energy-alerter.html sorry italian language only!).
