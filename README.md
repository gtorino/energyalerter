# Energy Alerter
The project consists of two parts, a server and a client, both made with an Arduino, and a few external components. It is inspired by the Open Energy Monitor which uses a slightly modified version dell'EmonTx V2.
Watch out further progresses on the web page dedicated to the project ( http://clockgenerator.blogspot.it/2016/04/energy-alerter.html sorry italian language only!).
